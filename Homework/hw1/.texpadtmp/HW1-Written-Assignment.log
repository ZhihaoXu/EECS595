I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.

./HW1-Written-Assignment.tex:99: Extra }, or forgotten $.
<recently read> }
                 
l.99 \end{align*}
                 
I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

./HW1-Written-Assignment.tex:99: Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.99 \end{align*}
                 
I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

./HW1-Written-Assignment.tex:99: Missing } inserted.
<inserted text> 
                }
l.99 \end{align*}
                 
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

<recently read> &
                 
l.99 \end{align*}
                 
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.
